###Process of Implementation and Problems Faced:###

1.The biggest problem that I faced was the fact that when I finally decided that i would want to work with a generative text output, I couldn't decide whether I
wanted to print it in the console or the canvas. Additionally, working around with the example given in class and making it more creative was a rattling task.
2.I also had a lot of trouble arriving at just the right opacity of each pixel( how bright or dark should an individual pixel be so that the features are enhanced).
After trying a lot of permutations and combinations I finally arrived at a satisfactory output.
3.Another major problem was the ordeal of debugging my code. I had accidentally replaced the word "height" with "length" due to which the code within the loop
simply didn't compile.

The process of implementation was a herculean task and would have been impossible if not for some help from my favourite Youtube channel entitled "The Coding Train".
Watching this video really helped understand various elements of p5.js and helped me achieve an artwork that I have always wanted to make.

###Learning outcomes:###
1. Understood how to alter the opacity of each pixel
2. Learnt how to pixalate the image
3. Learnt that low-pixalated images give better generative text outputs

###Concept of the Artwork:###
The concept of the artwork stemmed from the fact that I wanted to utilise the class learnings from the generative text output exercise and compile it with some image.
Since I happen to be a dog lover who is fond of the colours black and white, this artwork seemed like an obvious choice.
