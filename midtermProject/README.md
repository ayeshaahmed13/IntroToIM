# City Guess
## Midterm Project| Introduction to Interactive Media

City Guess is a very user-friendly game in which the player(s) have to attempt to guess the city that is displayed on the screen by taking cues from a pixellated image of a city under a timer that runs down from 10 seconds onwards. The game consists of 10 popular cities from across the globe and the user navigates from one screen to another with the help of clicking on the screen with the cursor.Each time a new city is revealed a bell is chimed.The user must correctly guess all the ten cities in order to complete the game successfully. At the end of the game the user is greeted with a kangaroo that declares the conclusion of the game with a distinct "end of the game" bell chime.

The welcome screen of the game has the instructions of the game in addition to the title of the game.In order to proceed to the gamescreen, the user is required to click anywhere on the welcome screen. The users are required to go thorough the instructions carefully before beginning.

The two screens below display both the pixellated and unpixelated version of the city.The image on the left displays the extremely pixellated picture that is observable when the timer begins at 10 and the image on the right displays the completely unpixellated image when the timer reaches 0.
