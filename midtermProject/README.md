The game consists of 10 popular cities from across the globe and the user navigates from one screen to another with the help of clicking on the screen with the cursor.Each time a new city is revealed a bell is chimed.The user must correctly guess all the ten cities in order to complete the game successfully. At the end of the game the user is greeted with a kangaroo that declares the conclusion of the game with a distinct "end of the game" bell chime.
