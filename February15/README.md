#### Process of implementation and Problems faced:
1. The biggest problem that I faced while making this project was the time crunch. With multiple assignments due at the same time, I believe I wasn't able to spend a lot of time on experimenting with different elements as I would have loved to. My fixated mentality on wanting to produce something impressive and procastination don't perhaps gel together.
2. I believe another pressing problem was the fact that after seeing multiple examples concerning OOP I was really intimidated and thought that I had to do something complicated, however later I figured that OOP has tremendous scope for drafting something small to something really huge.
3. I intially wanted to make three rotating toruses with  light radiating from their centre however it somehow didn't come together so that's why I experimented a little with the background and the frame rate, which led to something meaningful.

#### Learnings: 
1. I should let the idea incubate in my head and work on the piece in multiple sittings as opposed to working on it in one sitting.
2. I should perhaps try to work more with classes and constructors to get a better hang of these operators.
3. This asssignment has given a me deep understanding of the importance of creating objects and how efficient they make a program.
