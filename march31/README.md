## Assignment 5

### Unusual Switch:
Everytime a car nears parking curb and reaches the maximum possible distance, the LED glows which indicates that the driver must not continue further.

### Ideation:
I wanted to devise a switch that has practical applications.After looking at multiple examples, I was flooded with several ideas however due to lack of materials and time I was unable to carry out with my most of my ambitious ideas.I intially thought of using the door of a toy car as an unusual switch. So everytime, the door closes, the LED is illuminated which indicates that the door has been closed properly however if it isn't closed then the LED remains  not illuminated.In the absence of finding a car with a movable door I was unable to continue forward with this idea.

Bearing this idea in mind I wanted to utilise the switch to avert hazards caused during driving.As a driver myself, I have often encountered several problems while parking in parking lots especially while driving SUVs where owing to the height of the car the driver is unable to see the parking curb and has to park due to pure estimation. More often than not, the drivers end up hitting the bumper onto the curb and sometimes even overriding them.The presence of an LED on the parking curb not only averts collision of the bumper with the curb but also alerts the driver of the closing distance.

### Description:

The car tyres are lined with conductors and so is the parking curb.Everytime the car tyres touch the curb, the LED illuminates which is an indication that the driver must stop.

### Process:

- The basic circuit involving the Arduino was setup in a similar manner as it was done in class.
- The switch was primarily made by utilising two main conductors; aluminium foil and conducting wire.
- I intially setup the basic circuit and connnected it to the power source to the check the conenctions. I later added more connecting wires and lined the tyres with aluminium foil to complete the circuit.
- I replicated a parking lot setup by utilising a plastic straw that mimics an obsatcle while the aluminium foil resembles the curb. The cardboard box has been utilised as a parking lot.
- The toy car is then moved up and down the carrdboard box to illuminate and non-illuminate the LED.

Working of the Switch

### Problems and Solutions:
- The lack of conducting tape and other materials prevented me from implementing my intial idea.In their absence, I modified my idea.
- The connecting wires kept touching each other repeatedly for which I had to cahnge the orientation of my setup slightly.
- The aluminium foil lining the tyres kept falling off, despite gluing it. I lined the conducting wires around the tyres in such a manner that a foil is held in place.
- I had trouble getting hands on aluminium foil but I finally managed to get some from my friend.

### Discoveries:
The biggest discovery that I had while doing this project was that simple ciruits involving basic switches can have tremndous applicability in real life and sometimes the presence of a single LED can make things so much hasslefree.I also realised that even though people condemn switches as yet another simplistic part of the circuit, but in reality a great deal of work can be accomplished by their usage.
