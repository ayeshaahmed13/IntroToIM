## Assignment 6(April 5)
### Using digital and analog sensors

#### Description:
The program is largely cntrolled by the sensors, both digital and analog.Depending uponn the intensity of light in the environment a specific has benn programmed
to glow.The red led glows at low light intensity, the yellow glows at moderate light intensity whereas the green light glows only when the intemsity of light is very high.
The switch or the digital sensor in this program largely monitors the rate at which the LED's flicker.I tried to experimnent with different speeds of flickerig.
In case of the Red LED the flickering becomes more delayed however in the case of green, it becomes faster and in the yellow LED we don't really see an apparent
change.
