##Your Process, workrounds and interesting findings##
The process of making the digital artwork was really a meaningful and rewarding experience however it was equally challenging one because I didn't really know how I  
could connect my class learnings to what was expected in class. Additionally, I believe I theoretically understood what for and while loops mean however transalating 
that into practical understanding was herculean. A new aspect that I learnt was how to make a rotating cube at the centre of the artwork and making that more coherent
with the background changes.
