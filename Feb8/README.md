#### Process of implementation and Problems faced:
1. I theoretically understood the ````for()```` and ````while()```` loops, however I had a significant difficulty applying them practically. Additionally, I also had a lot of fun experimenting while making a rotating cube, and compiling that with a dynamic background even though it was a herculean task, it was a rewarding expereince. 
2. Initially starting off looking at a blank screen was very intimidating. Especially, acknowledging the fact that I have no coding background and most of my other friends were already using complex algorithms to draft masterpeices. I underestimated the amount of time the assignment would take and I now realize its essential to start off sooner. 

#### Learnings: 
1. Become more practical and less ambitious about what I expect from my own work.
2. I believe the quality of my work doesn't depend on the amount of time I spend on it in one sitting but rather on the number of sittings that I devote to it.
3. It does take a lot of time to understand the syntax of the code itself. Then materializing that understanding in my work is another herculean task.
